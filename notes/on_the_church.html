<td><b>Executive Summary</b>
<p>The church is an organism made up of the people God has called to Christ.&nbsp;
Christ is the head, and the church submits to him.&nbsp; The church is
like a building, made up of believers as living stones, with Christ, the
apostles, and the prophets as the foundation.
<p>Fellowship in the church is spiritual, not psychological, social or
selfish. Therefore, church should be seen as a place for us to minister
to each other - through&nbsp; teaching, exhortation, encouragement, etc.</td>

<td><b>The "On This Rock" Question (Matthew 16:15-18)</b>
<p>[Jesus] said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”&nbsp; Simon Peter
answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”&nbsp; And Jesus
answered him, “You are blessed, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood
did not reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven!&nbsp; And I tell you
that you are Peter, and <b>on this rock I will build my church</b>, and
the gates of Hades will not overpower it."

<td><b>Other Implications</b>
<p><i>We are members</i>.&nbsp; The Bible was written primarily for the
church.&nbsp; The vast majority of the New Testament books were written
to or about churches, rather than individuals. The Bible is almost useless
for the "Lone Ranger Christian".&nbsp; Abiding in Christ includes a healthy
desire for fellowship in a church.
<p><i>No partiality.</i> Christ builds the church with finely detailed
attention to each member. We're here for specific reasons, with the goal
of building up the church (Ephesians 4:29).&nbsp; Members we don't like
are more important to the church than we know, and in some cases we may
be questioning Christ's judgement...
<p><i>Evangelism</i>. The church began reaching out to all people almost
from the start.&nbsp; Evangelists preached using the figures and terms
of the cultures they worked in - compare Acts 7 and Hebrews (to Jews),
Romans (to Romans), Galatians (to Celts), and Acts 17 (to Greeks).
<p><i>Be on guard!</i>&nbsp; The head is Christ -- therefore, every teacher's
teachings are subject to Christ. It is every member's responsibility to
evaluate all teachings in the church as best as possible.&nbsp; All teachings
are measured against the Bible &amp; the gospel. (Drew Berkemeyer's litmus
test: "the answer to everything is: Jesus Christ")</td>
